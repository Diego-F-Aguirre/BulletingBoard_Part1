    // Note: the recordType key is actually the name of the model object so in this instance it's "Message". This is similar concept as the entity name in CoreData
    // Note: because we're in a extension we can't create properties so the workaround is to create a static var computed property that return's the keyname

    // 1. Here we're creating a failable initializer for our CKRecord that we hope to receive back from the Apple servers.
    // A CKRecord contains data in a key/value pair... so a CKRecord is literally just a glorified Dictionary. This is stated in the documentation, have the students take a quick look.
    // Like any failable initializer we need to make sure we're matching with the correct key

            // finally every record has a recordType and here we're making sure we're making sure to get back only the records with the type that match our Message model recordType. As we can have more than one CKRecords each with their own type.
